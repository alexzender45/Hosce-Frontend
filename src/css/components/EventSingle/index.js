                                        <li>On behalf of our partners and management of The Rock Fes, I bring greetings to you. </li>
                                        <li>Today is indeed a memorable day in our history and in our lives. It is memorable because it has brought visionary people; business management experts and philanthropists together 
                                            to fight ignorance and eradicate poverty in our world through HOSCE programme.</li>
                                            <li>First, we understand that HOSCE stands for Help Others Succeed Community Empowerment. The aim of the programme is to train people in business management 
                                                and to assist every member to make daily income as well as raise funds for business and other projects. </li>
                                            <li>HOSCE goal is to assist at least 100,000,000 people become financially free across the globe; especially in the third world nations.</li> 
                                            <li>The programme is for business owners, job seekers, unemployed persons, salary earners, and anyone who desires to experience financial freedom. </li> 
                                            <li>The good thing about HOSCE programme is that your income goes to your local account once it hits on our database</li>
                                            <li>It is good to know that no MLM company in history has such a payment structure that offers partners 50% of the registration fee of partners under them, 50% spillover bonuses, performance bonus,
                                                 cash back bonus and other bonuses. This sounds pretty cool to the ears and they are real. </li>
                                            <li>Ladies and Gentlemen, HOSCE business is here and we are part of the wave. Let us run with the vision and create wealth for ourselves, our family members, our friends and neighbors. I am proud to be partner of this great vision.</li>
                                            <li>It is my pleasure to officially present HOSCE business training and empowerment programme for the prosperity of mankind and to the Glory of the Almighty God.</li>

                                <p>I welcome you to this event.
                                 My name is Hon. Rev. Ezekwesiri B. Otti, a force in HOSCE business in this part of the world.  </p>
                                 <p>As a pastor and an entrepreneur, I feel very happy being part of HOSCE project. My dream ever since I was born is to see how I can help my fellow man or woman become better and solve his or her problems in all ramifications; especially financial problems.
                                 Today, HOSCE has made that dream a reality, and I feel excited being part of the project. </p>
                                 <p>For me, no one has money problem; it’s always a faith problem… Faith to believe that you can and the faith to accept any worthwhile opportunity that has the capacity to change your life for good, and that is exactly what HOSCE does;
                                 impacting business skills and creating wealth.</p>
                                 <p>Both those of us who have joined the programme and those that are yet to join, we are simply in a race to end poverty and create wealth opportunities for ourselves.
                                 With HOSCE lies the opportunity to dream big and to achieve more. </p>
                                 <p>Friends, I thank the few of us that gathered here today for the approval of HOSCE business in Africa. I pray that through HOSCE the hopeless becomes hopeful, the unemployed engages himself productively and the gap between the poor and rich is bridged.
                                     This is my hope and that is what HOSCE stands for.</p>
                                     <p>God bless you.</p>
